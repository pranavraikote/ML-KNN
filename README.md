# ML-KNN
Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm using Python

# About
K-nearest neighbors algorithm is a simple classification algorithm. KNN algorithms use given data and classify new data points based on a similarity measures (e.g. distance function). Classification is done by a majority vote to its neighbors. The data is assigned to the class which has the most nearest neighbors. As you increase the number of nearest neighbors, the value of k, accuracy might increase.
 
# Applications
